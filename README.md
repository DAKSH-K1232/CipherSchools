CipherStudio Assignment Document
Title: Build CipherStudio - Your Browser-Based React IDE
1. Objective
Your task is to design and implement a browser-based React IDE called CipherStudio, where users can:
Create and manage multiple files for a React project.
Write React code in the browser.
Run and preview their project live inside the browser.
Save and reload their projects to continue later.
The goal is to simulate a real online development environment similar to platforms like NextLeap.js or CodeSandbox, while testing your full-stack design thinking, frontend skills, and integration ability.

2. Features to Implement
Core Features (Required):
File Management: Users can create, delete, and organize project files.
Code Editor: A rich code editor to write React components (Monaco Editor or Sandpack).
Live Preview: Display the React project output in real-time as the code changes.
Save & Load Projects: Users can save their project state and reload it later from localStorage with the help of projectId.
UI/UX: Clean and intuitive interface
Optional/Bonus Features:
Theme switcher (dark/light).
Rename files/folders
Login/Register 
Deployment/Hosting
Autosave feature (toggle)
Responsive UI: Usable on desktop and tablet screens.


You may use open-source libraries (like Sandpack) for React code execution. The goal is integration and feature implementation, not building a compiler from scratch.

3. Tech Stack
Layer
Recommended Technology
Frontend
React / Next.js
Code Execution
Sandpack (CodeSandbox)
Editor
Monaco Editor or Sandpack editor
Database
MongoDB (Atlas preferred) and AWS S3 for files
Backend
Node.js / Express.js (for project persistence)
Deployment
Vercel (Frontend) + Render/Railway/Cyclic (Backend)


You may choose alternatives if needed, but ensure they support the required functionality.

4. Deliverables
GitHub Repository
Frontend code and backend code
README.md explaining project structure and features (optional)


Live Demo URL (Optional)
Vercel deployment for frontend
Backend deployed on Render/Railway


Project Demo (Optional)
A 2â€“3 minute video demonstrating the IDE: creating files, writing code, running the project, and saving/loading functionality.


Documentation (Optional)
Describe the high-level architecture
Explain any major design decisions



5. Timeline
Duration: 3 days
Focus on completing the core MVP first before adding optional features.
Prioritize usability, structure, and working preview functionality over exhaustive polish.
